# Creating a TypeScript Package

There are a lot of different TypeScript setups out there. Some of these are correct, some of them
have invalid configurations that may or may not work by accident, others are outdated, This guide
will walk you through steps to setup a basic minimal TypeScript package with some tests.

## Table of Contents

- [Gitting started](#gitting-started)
  - [`.gitignore`](#gitignore)
  - [`package.json`](#packagejson)

- [Automate publishing](#automate-publishing)
  - [Create a repository](#create-a-repository)
  - [GitHub actions](#github-actions)
  - [Publishing](#publishing)
- [Further configuration](#further-configuration)

## Gitting started

To get started, create a new folder and initialize a git repository.

```sh
mkdir my-package
cd my-package
git init
```

### `.gitignore`

A TypeScript project contains some generated files. We don’t want to commit those to git, so we need
a `.gitignore` file.

```text
# This directory contains our dependencies
node_modules/

# This is where we will write our compiled output
dist/

# The result of `npm pack`
*.tgz
```

### `package.json`

Next, create a file named `package.json`. `package.json` is the entrypoint of your npm package.

```json
{
  "name": "my-package",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "type": "module",
  "exports": "./dist/my-package.js",
  "main": "./dist/my-package.js",
  "repository": "my-github-username/my-package",
  "files": [
    "dist",
    "src",
    "!*.test.*"
  ],
  "scripts": {
    "prepack": "tsc --build",
    "pretest": "tsc --build",
    "test": "node --enable-source-maps --test"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/node": "^20.0.0",
    "typescript": "^5.0.0"
  }
}
```

`name` is the name of the package through which it will be available on npm. In this case, your
users will be able to install the package by running `npm install my-package`. It is also the name
using which users will import your package.

`version` is the [semantic version](https://semver.org) of your package. We will keep it `0.0.0` to
get started.

`description` is a short single line description of your package.

`type` indicates the type of files with a `.js` or `.ts` extension. The default is `commonjs`, but
it’s best to always set it explicitly. For new packages I recommend using `module`.

`exports` determines which file will be resolved when your package is imported. In this example, the
following import:

```js
import 'my-package'
```

resolves to the `dist/my-package.js` file in your package. Package exports support more complex
configurations to support different entrypoints and export conditions, but that’s out of scope for
this guide. For more information on that, see the Node.js documentation on
[Package entry points](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#package-entry-points).

`main` is mostly no longer used if `exports` is defined. Some bundlers still use it. It’s also used
by TypeScript’s legacy module resolution algorithms.

`files` determines which files should be included in the package. Typically you write TypeScript
code in a `src` directory, and emit it to the `dist` directory. Different projects may use different
folder names, but for this example we’ll stick with those. In our example the tests will follow the
`*.test.ts` naming pattern. We don’t want to publish tests, so those are excluded.

`scripts` may contain various reusable scripts. Some special names are used for
[life cycle scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/using-npm/scripts#life-cycle-scripts). A
TypeScript project typicall contains the following life cycle scripts:

- `test` — This script is run when you run `npm test`, which is the most common way to run tests.
  Our example uses the [Node.js test runner](https://nodejs.org/api/test.html), which is why the
  test script runs `node --enable-source-maps --test`.
- `pretest` — Node.js can’t run TypeScript code. The TypeScript project needs to be compiled first.
  The `pretest` script runs before the `test` script, which is why we build the project here with
  `tsc --build`.
- `prepack` — The prepack script runs before creating a package from the repository. For example
  this runs before you run `npm pack` or `npm publish`. Since we want to compile the TypeScript
  before packing, this script runs `tsc --build`.

`devDependencies` contains the dependencies needed to develop the project. For our project we need
`typescript` for compiling the project, and `@types/node` to get type definitions for the Node.js
test runner.

After creating `package.json`, run `npm install` to install dependencies and create a
`package-lock.json` file.

### `tsconfig.json`

Our next file is `tsconfig.json`. `tsconfig.json` configures your TypeScript program.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "declaration": true,
    "declarationMap": true,
    "lib": "es2022",
    "module": "nodenext",
    "outDir": "dist",
    "rootDir": "src",
    "sourceMap": true,
    "strict": true,
    "target": "es2022"
  }
}
```

`strict` enables several recommended strict type checking options. This is generally recommended for
new projects.

`target` configures the ECMAScript version we want to support. Our package will target Node.js 18,
for which `es2022` is sufficient. `lib` needs to match the target. If your package is for use in the
browser, you can omit `lib`. By default it will match your target, and also include the matching DOM
types.

`rootDir` specifies where we will author the source code. `outDir` specifies where the compiled
output should be written.

`declaration` specifies we want to emit TypeScript declaration files. Without declaration files, the
package can’t be consumed by TypeScript users who want to use this package. `declarationMap` emits a
declaration map for each declaration file. If this is included, _Go to definition_ from within an
editor will take the user to the source code from which the declaration file was generated instead
of the declaration file itself. `sourceMap` allows certain tools such as debuggers or stack traces
to map the compiled output back to the source code.

`module` configures the module system to use. For libraries you should use `nodenext` or `node16`.
Those are equivalent at the moment of writing. For applications that are bundled you should use
`preserve`. Other `module` options are outdated and should not be used. The `module` option also
configures `moduleResolution` and `esModuleInterop` for you, so you shouldn’t specify those.

## The code

Since the focus of this guide is on creating a project, the code example will be very minimal.

The entry point refers to `my-package.js` in the out dir. We need to match this file in out root
dir. So our source code will be in `src/my-package.ts`. Let’s write the following content:

```typescript
export function greet(name = 'you'): string {
  return `Hello ${name}!`
}
```

We also need a test file. Let’s name it `src/my-package.test.ts`.

```typescript
import assert from 'node:assert/strict'
import { test } from 'node:test'
import { greet } from 'my-package'

test('greet with name', () => {
  const greeting = greet('Remco')

  assert.equal(greeting, 'Hello Remco!')
})

test('greet without', () => {
  const greeting = greet()

  assert.equal(greeting, 'Hello you!')
})
```

Note that in our test, we import `greet` from `my-package`. We could have imported `greet` from
`./my-package.js`. However, by importing from it `my-package` we do not only test the `greet`
function, we also make sure that it is properly exported in the public interface.

Now to run the tests, run `npm test`.

## Automate publishing

Now that we have a useful package, let’s publish it. This section will focus on using
[GitHub](https://github.com), but the same concepts apply to other hosting platforms.

### Create a repository

First, [create a new repository on GitHub](https://github.com/new). Next we commit what we have.
Then we add the new GitHub repository as the `origin` remote, and we push to GitHub.

```sh
git add .
git commit -m 'Initial commit'
git remote add origin 'git@github.com:my-github-username/my-package.git'
git push -u origin main
```

If everything went well, your project is now on GitHub.

### GitHub actions

Next we create a GitHub [workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows) to automate
testing and publishing. Create the file `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
name: ci

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    tags: ['*']

jobs:
  pack:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm pack
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: package
          path: '*.tgz'

  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version:
          - 18
          - 20
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test

  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs:
      - pack
      - test
    if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
    steps:
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
          registry-url: https://registry.npmjs.org
      - uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with: { name: package }
      - run: npm publish *.tgz --provenance --access public
        env:
          NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
```

This workflow does the following:

- It runs for every push to the `main` branch, every tag, and every pull request.
- The `pack` job creates a package for every run which can be downloaded and introspected as a build
  artifact.
- The `test` job runs the test for Node.js versions 18 and 20.
- The `release` job runs only if a tag is pushed. It downloads the package built by the `pack` job,
  and publishes it to npm.

The release job needs an npm access token. To get an npm access token, go to
[npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com) and log in. Click on your profile avatar → _Access Tokens_ →
_Generate New Token_ and follow the instructions. Copy the access token.

From your project on GitHub, go to _Settings_ → _Secrets and variables_ → _Actions_. Click _New
repository secret_. As the name, enter `NPM_TOKEN`. This needs to match the secret used in the
workflow file. Paste the npm token in the _Secret_ field, and click _Add secret_.

Add, commit, and push this file.

```sh
git add .github/workflows/ci.yaml
git commit -m 'Add CI workflow'
git push
```

### Publishing

Now all you need to do to publish this, is push a new tag to GitHub. The
[`npm version`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npm-version) command increases the version
and creates a git tag. So all you need to run to publish version 0.0.1 is:

```sh
npm version patch
git push --tags
```

You will receive an email from npm when your package is published succesfully.

## Further configuration

This post only shows the a minimal TypeScript project. It’s strongly recommended to add some more
metadata to your project, including:

- A [readme](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes)
- A [license](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository)
- Code quality tools such as [ESLint](https://eslint.org), [Prettier](https://prettier.io), and
  [remark-lint](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint).
- An [`.editorconfig`](http://editorconfig.org) file
- Code coverage checks.

However, that’s out of scope for this post.
