<main>
  I’m a freelance software developer from the Netherlands who loves working on open source software.
  I am currently open to new opportunities, but I’m not actively looking. I like to focus on proper
  solutions and high code quality, not hacky workarounds. Lately I have been interested in
  development tooling. If you’re interested to see what I’m currently working on, please visit my
  GitHub profile.

  <section>
    ## <Icon icon="javascript" /> JavaScript

    I mainly focus on JavaScript. This includes Node.js, TypeScript, JSX, and React. Below are some
    of the highlights, but it’s not everything I’ve worked on. To see more of my projects and
    contributions, visit my GitHub and GitLab profiles.

        ### <span className="unified">uni</span>fied

        I’m part of the unified collective. The unified collective is an ecosystem of tools and
        plugins for working with ASTs. This can be used for transforming and validating code. For
        example, it can be used to transform markdown to HTML, or for spell checking.

        ### <Icon icon="volar" /> Volar

        [Volar](https://volarjs.dev) is a framework for building embedded language tooling. It
        powers the tooling for languages such as [Vue](https://vuejs.org) and
        [Astro](https://astro.build). I started using Volar to build the MDX language tooling. As I
        got more involved, I became part of the team. By sharing a common foundation between the
        various languages adapting Volar, bugs get fixed for everyone, which leads to more stability
        in language tooling in the JavaScript ecosystem overall.

        ### Language server

        The language server protocol allows editors to provide smart language features. Monaco
        editor is a code editor for the browser. It is the same editor that’s used in Visual Studio
        Code. I worked on some projects which involve these concepts.

        I maintain various [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) extensions.

    ## <Icon icon="python" /> Python

    When I first started working on open source software, I was mainly using Python. Although I
    mainly use JavaScript nowadays, I still do like Python. Unfortunately most of my Python code is
    closed source. My first ever project was a GTK2 based minesweeper game. My first open source
    project was wakeonlan for Python.

    <h2 className="linux">Linux</h2>

    I am a Linux user and enthusiast. I first started using Ubuntu Linux in 2008 and I’ve loved
    using it ever since. I love that it’s free, open source, customizable and dark mode was
    supported far before it became mainstream. Using Linux is also what sparked my interest in
    programming.

    As I started becoming more invested in software and open source, I also started appreciating the
    terminal. Right now I can’t imagine working without a terminal and proper tab completion.

    Later my Linux experience also helped me truly undestand Docker and Kubernetes.

    ## Jobs & Education

    <div className="grid">
      <JobSection from={2024} icon="transloadit" name="Transloadit" to="Present">
        [Transloadit](https://transloadit.com) provides an API do handle various file transforms. I
        help maintain their website. For example, I added smart editor support to their JSON editor.
        I also help out with TypeScript integration and various miscellaneous issues.
      </JobSection>

      <JobSection from={2023} icon="cuescript" name="CueScript" to="Present">
        [CueScript](https://www.cuescript.tv) is a company that builds teleprompters. Their new
        teleprompting software uses [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor) under
        the hood. Some important requirements for them are to use different text sizes and
        right-to-left text support. However, Monaco Editor did not support that. I added support for
        that to Monaco Editor, as well as support for the line wrapping calculations that come with
        it. This all had to be implemented with a big focus on performance.
      </JobSection>

      <JobSection from={2022} icon="motif" name="Motif" to={2023}>
        I worked as a freelance developer for [Motif](https://motif.land) (now
        [Markprompt](https://markprompt.com)). Motif was a web based editor which allows people to
        create beautiful websites while they can still focus on content. It leverages the latest web
        technologies such as MDX, React, and Tailwind CSS.

        What I liked about working at Motif is they want to invest in these open source
        technologies.
      </JobSection>

      <JobSection from={2017} icon="appsemble" name="Appsemble" to={2022}>
        [Appsemble](https://appsemble.app) is a low-code app building platform. it allows users to
        define what an app looks like using a YAML file. An app contains blocks, which can also be
        custom built. This combination allows users to build apps with minimal technical skill, and
        allows them to extend the platform if they are willing to.

        At Appsemble I’m involved with the full stack. This ranges from typical front end React code
        and UX to the Node.js back end, database management, Kubernetes, and CI/CD. I still help
        them out every now and then on a freelance basis.

        The source code of Appsemble is open source and available on
        [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/appsemble).
      </JobSection>

      <JobSection from={2013} icon="d-centralize" name="d-centralize" to={2017}>
        My first job was at [d-centraize](https://d-centralize.nl). I started my internship here and
        stayed around afterwards. At d-centralize I worked on various projects, including
        [Pro6PP](https://pro6pp.nl), [ITSLanguage](https://itslanguage.nl), and
        [InContract](https://incontract.nl). At d-centralize I worked as a full stack developer
        using Python, Google Cloud, Flask, AngularJS, Cordova, and later Node.js and React.

        Appsemble is also part of d-centralize. Eventually my focus within d-centralize shifted
        solely to Appsemble.
      </JobSection>

      <JobSection from={2011} icon="fontys" name="Fontys" to={2015}>
        At Fontys I followed the IT course with a focus on software engineering and a bit of ethical
        hacking. The study focuses a lot on object-oriented programming in Java and C#.

        Although I left the technology stack used at Fontys behind, it’s also the place where I
        learnt various other skills, such as working together in groups, using version control
        systems, and many of the programming basics.

    ## Hobbies & Interests

    I do love writing software, but that’s not all I do. For starters I love listening to music! I
    listen to music almost all the time, mostly metal and folk music 🤘. You should really check out
    [Machinae Supremacy](https://machinaesupremacy.com) and
    [Diablo Swing Orchestra](https://diabloswing.com).

    Also I like playing games. This includes board games, but also table top role playing games such
    as [Pathfinder](https://paizo.com/pathfinder) and [Starfinder](https://paizo.com/starfinder). I
    also enjoy playing video games, but I don’t consider myself to be a hardcore gamer. I mostly
    play [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net) and [Nintendo](https://nintendo.com) games.
